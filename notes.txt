the app itself will have a framework of logic and components

first - download VS Code extensions:
ES7+ React/Redux/React-Native snippets
chrome extension - React Developer Tools

rendering elements
-React only updates what's necessary:
    -when ppl interact with the page, the "state" of a component may change
    -this may lead to the child of the component to change, too
    *React DOM will compare the element to its children to the previous element & only updates ones that have changed...
    *think of how each element should LOOK like, rather than updating the whole thing all the time

to define a component, write a JavaScript function:
function Welcome(props){
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}

    *function-components will take in ONE parameter and it's always called 'props'

add Bootstrap stylings - 
copy text
